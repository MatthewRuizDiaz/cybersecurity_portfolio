This repo stores all my work and experiences related to the field of cybersecurity.

# Professional Statement:

The field of cybersecurity is impactful to me because of the opportunity to use and create techniques that will be used now and in the future to prevent threat actors from harming people. I remember how concerned I was when I heard about the Accellion data breach where personally identifiable information from thousands of students was compromised. Having strong adaptability to a rapidly changing landscape as well as solid accountability and attention to detail in my work, as I have exemplified in my academic career by maintaining a strong GPA and reputation, will allow me to successfully add value to whichever organization I work for. Building trust between a company and its users is essential for companies handling user data on a massive scale and I plan to be valuable in this pursuit by ensuring my primary goal in any situation is always to protect the people most at risk.

# Conducting a Security Audit:

This project demonstrates my ability to complete a security audit for an organization. In this example, the company is Botium Company which does not exist but has one physical location and an online store which conducts credit card transations and stores personally identifiable information, internationally. It's security posture was extremely high risk and the documents written describe the audit through a controls assessment, compliance checklist, and finally a memo to stakeholders describing the situation and the steps to take to have an industry standard security posture. 

# Incident Report - Network Traffic Analysis:

This document shows my ability to complete an incident report using network analysis and tcpdump logs. The document states all relevant information about the incident: what time it was reported and by who, as well as the network teams response, investigation, progress and solution. 

# Incident Report - Analyzing Network Attacks:

This document has a writeup relating to an example SYN flooding attack. It shows how the attack was recognized from wireshark logs and the exact way a SYN connection is supposed to be formed. It also demonstrates an understanding of the exact consequences of one of these attacks should they be successful.

# Incident Report - Brute Force Incident:

This document is an incident report relating to a simulated brute force attack on a simple website. The attacker gained admin privileges by brute force to obtain the username and password. They changed the source code to insert a javascript function to download a malicious file and redirect the user to another website, all using the HTTP protocol. This work shows an understanding of HTTP protocols vulnerabilities and to read network logs.

# Risk Assessment Report - Defense Hardening:

This document is a list of recommendations for certain NIST standards and firewall strategies to harden the defenses of a network given a breach to an organization. I also give recomendations for MFA, internal permissions auditing, and potential attacks. 

# Linux File Permissions Activity:

This document shows a situation where an organization needs to manage file permissions on its linux system to be in compliance with the principle of least permissions. This is done by changing the permissions on every file, with specific instructions for the user, the group, and other. Every task was completed using linux commands in the CLI. 

# SQL Query and Filtering Activity:

This document describes a scenario where an organization wants to investigate certain security issues and update some outdated computers. This is done by using SQL to query specific data relating to those security issues as well as employees that have outdated computers. There is a login_attempts table as well as an employees table and I pulled data from both. 

# Vulnerability Assessment Report:

This document is an assessment of the vulnerability to assets contained in a database configuration which consists of: a 128 GB server, MySQL DB management software, and a stable network. 

# Incident Handler's Journal:

This document is a collection of journal entries relating to security incidents and a detailed description of what happened, what tools were used, and specific information regarding the event plus any additional notes. This was made to show knowledge of traditional documentation in incident response to learn and prevent similar situations from recurring.

# Algorithm for Python File Updates Activity:

This document contains the workflow of a python algorithm designed to update files, specifically it changes a text file with access control privileges from an old list to an updated list. This is done using built-in python functions such as read, write, and open.

# Notes
I would like to add that some of these documents are templates provided by the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program but all work done in them is my own.
