This repo stores all my work and experiences related to the field of cybersecurity.

# Professional Statement:

The field of cybersecurity is impactful to me because of the opportunity to use and create techniques that will be used now and in the future to prevent threat actors from harming people. I remember how concerned I was when I heard about the Accellion data breach where personally identifiable information from thousands of students was compromised. Having strong adaptability to a rapidly changing landscape as well as solid accountability and attention to detail in my work, as I have exemplified in my academic career by maintaining a strong GPA and reputation, will allow me to successfully add value to whichever organization I work for. Building trust between a company and its users is essential for companies handling user data on a massive scale and I plan to be valuable in this pursuit by ensuring my primary goal in any situation is always to protect the people most at risk.

# Conducting a Security Audit:

This project demonstrates my ability to complete a security audit for an organization. In this example, the company is Botium Company which does not exist but has one physical location and an online store which conducts credit card transations and stores personally identifiable information, internationally. It's security posture was extremely high risk and the documents written describe the audit through a controls assessment, compliance checklist, and finally a memo to stakeholders describing the situation and the steps to take to have an industry standard security posture. 

# Cyber Security Incident Report:

This document shows my ability to complete an incident report using network analysis and tcpdump logs. The document states all relevant information about the incident: what time it was reported and by who, as well as the network teams response, investigation, progress and solution.
